This project is aimed for learning purposes. The main learned and used framework and libraries are FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Pydantic.
Backend endpoints and functionalities were developed to manage users and user-specific transactions.
In the future the goal is to develop a frontend to easily access these endpoints and interact with them.
